# A-demo-of-combining-two-DL-model-into-one-to-predict-probabilities-of-fraud-detection
This model uses Artificial Neural Network and Self Organizing Maps for the combination syntax and techniques. SOM will cluster out the possible fraud customers and ANN will use them to predict the probabilities of a customer being fraud. This is a demo example for practice purpose.
